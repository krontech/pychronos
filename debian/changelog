  * Fixed _folders not showing up. Hopefully.
  * Test to see if _folders are getting ignored by gh-pages.
  * Tweaks to index.rst for formatting and clarity. Added SVG to make watch.
  * Improvements to the docs build process.

  * Added some examples to README.md, clarifying what keys are returned and how to use them.
  * Added 150 timeouts to pychronos video API interactions.
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:krontech/pychronos
  * Added some property stubs related to power.
  * Fixed watch-camera not reloading when a change happened.
  * Added derivedFrom to the camProperty decorator to fix saving derived props.
  * Removed unused imports from some files.
  * Fix minor bugs and errors in the IO properties.
  * Added exposureNormalized to compliment exposurePercent. Cleaned up docs. â˜º
  * Add Conflicts dependency between cam-control and camApp
  * Add frameGeometry to sensor autodocumentation.
  * Fixed issue with 'config' parameter not being gettable. Also changed timing system so calls from 
    the same mode don't go to the interm mode while changing - This needs further testing and 
    validation.
  * Fixed an issue where if it was unable to get a frame it would cause issues
  * fixed bug in lux1310 and made idnum able to convert from strings
  * Fix bug preventing normal recording from using the ring buffer.
